<purpose>
Mark a milestone as complete. Verify all phases are closed, check for audit status,
generate a retrospective summary stored in the milestone bead, and close the milestone epic.
All state lives in the bead graph -- no file archival needed.
</purpose>

<process>

## 1. Find Project and Milestone

```bash
PROJECT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" find-project)
```

If no project found, report "No Forge project found" and suggest `/forge:new`. Stop.

Extract the project ID.

If a milestone ID was given as argument, use it directly.

Otherwise, list milestones to find the active one:
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" milestone-list <project-id>
```

If no open milestones exist:
```
No active milestone found. Use /forge:new-milestone to start one.
```
Stop.

## 2. Check Audit Status

Look for audit results on the milestone bead:
```bash
bd show <milestone-id> --json
```

Check the design field for audit results (stored by /forge:audit-milestone).

**If no audit exists:**
```
No milestone audit found. Recommend running /forge:audit-milestone first
to verify requirements coverage and cross-phase integration.
```
Use AskUserQuestion:
- options: "Run audit first" | "Proceed without audit" | "Cancel"

**If audit found gaps:**
```
Milestone audit found gaps. Recommend running /forge:plan-milestone-gaps
to create phases that close the gaps, or proceed to accept as known debt.
```
Use AskUserQuestion:
- options: "Plan gap closure" | "Proceed anyway (accept gaps)" | "Cancel"

**If audit passed:** Proceed to step 3.

## 3. Verify Phase Completion

Get all phases under the milestone:
```bash
bd children <milestone-id> --json
```

Filter to forge:phase beads. Check each phase's status.

**If all phases are closed:** Continue.

**If some phases are still open:**
```
Incomplete phases found:
- Phase N: <name> (status: <status>)
- Phase M: <name> (status: <status>)
```

Use AskUserQuestion:
- options:
  - "Proceed anyway (mark incomplete phases as deferred)"
  - "Go back and finish them"
  - "Cancel"

If "Proceed anyway": Close incomplete phases with reason:
```bash
bd close <phase-id> --reason="deferred: milestone completion"
```

## 4. Gather Accomplishments

For each closed phase, extract what was accomplished:
```bash
bd show <phase-id> --json
```

Read the phase description and its closed tasks:
```bash
bd children <phase-id> --json
```

Compile 4-8 key accomplishments from across all phases.

Present to user for review:
```
Key accomplishments for this milestone:
1. <Achievement from phase 1>
2. <Achievement from phase 2>
...
```

## 5. Check Requirement Coverage

List all requirements under the milestone:
```bash
bd children <milestone-id> --json
```

Filter to forge:req beads. For each requirement, check if any task validates it:
```bash
bd dep list <req-id> --type validates --json
```

Report coverage:
```
Requirements: N/M satisfied
- REQ: <title> -- SATISFIED (validated by <task-ids>)
- REQ: <title> -- UNSATISFIED (no validating tasks found)
```

Record unsatisfied requirements as known gaps in the retrospective.

## 6. Generate Retrospective

Compile the milestone retrospective and store it in the bead:

```bash
bd update <milestone-id> --notes="Retrospective:

## Accomplishments
<accomplishment list>

## Requirements Coverage
<N/M requirements satisfied>
<list of unsatisfied requirements if any>

## Known Gaps / Tech Debt
<gaps from audit or uncovered requirements>

## Stats
- Phases: <N>
- Tasks completed: <M>
- Requirements satisfied: <X/Y>

Completed: <date>"
```

## 7. Close Milestone

```bash
bd close <milestone-id> --reason="Milestone complete. <N> phases, <M/Y> requirements satisfied."
```

## 8. Report and Next Steps

```
# Milestone Complete

**<milestone name>**

Phases: <N> completed
Requirements: <M/Y> satisfied
<known gaps summary if any>

Retrospective stored in milestone bead (<milestone-id>).

Next steps:
- /forge:new-milestone -- start next milestone cycle
- /forge:progress -- see updated project status
- /forge:cleanup -- clean up stale beads from completed work
```
