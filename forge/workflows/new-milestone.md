<purpose>
Start a new milestone cycle for an existing Forge project. Loads project context from the bead
graph, gathers milestone goals, creates a milestone epic bead, defines scoped requirements as
forge:req beads, and spawns the roadmapper to create a phased execution plan. Phase numbering
continues from previous work.
</purpose>

<process>

## 1. Find Project

```bash
PROJECT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" find-project)
```

If no project found, report "No Forge project found" and suggest `/forge:new`. Stop.

Extract the project ID.

## 2. Load Project Context

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" project-context <project-id>
```

From the result, extract:
- Project vision and description
- Existing requirements (forge:req beads) -- what's already been built
- Existing phases and their status -- what's been completed
- Any existing milestones (forge:milestone beads)

Present a summary of what shipped in the last milestone (if any).

## 3. Gather Milestone Goals

**If milestone name was passed as argument:** Use it as the starting point.

**Otherwise:** Ask the user with AskUserQuestion:
- header: "New Milestone"
- question: "What do you want to build next?"
- Allow freeform text response

Follow up with probing questions to clarify scope:
- What are the key features or capabilities?
- Who benefits most from this work?
- What constraints or dependencies exist?
- What does "done" look like for this milestone?

## 4. Create Milestone Epic

```bash
bd create --title="Milestone: <name>" \
  --description="<goal synthesized from answers>" \
  --design="<scope, constraints, and definition of done>" \
  --type=epic --priority=1 --json
```

Label and wire it:
```bash
bd label add <milestone-id> forge:milestone
bd dep add <milestone-id> <project-id> --type=parent-child
```

Save for reference:
```bash
bd remember "forge:milestone:<id>:goal <one-line goal>"
```

## 5. Define Requirements

Based on the user's milestone goals, break them down into 5-12 concrete requirements.

Present the full list to the user for review before creating any beads. Let them add, remove,
or modify requirements. Iterate until they approve.

For each approved requirement:
```bash
bd create --title="<requirement title>" \
  --description="<what this requirement means and why it matters>" \
  --type=feature --priority=<1-3> --json
bd dep add <req-id> <milestone-id> --type=parent-child
bd label add <req-id> forge:req
```

## 6. Research Decision (Optional)

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before creating the roadmap?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended for new capabilities)"
  - "Skip research (go straight to roadmap)"

**If "Research first":**

Resolve the model for the researcher agent:
```bash
MODEL=$(node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" resolve-model forge-researcher --raw)
```

Spawn 2-4 parallel **forge-researcher** agents covering:
- Stack/library choices for new capabilities
- Feature patterns and best practices
- Architecture integration with existing codebase
- Common pitfalls

Record key findings as notes on the milestone bead:
```bash
bd update <milestone-id> --notes="Research findings: <key points>"
```

**If "Skip research":** Continue to step 7.

## 7. Create Phased Roadmap

Resolve the model for the roadmapper agent:
```bash
MODEL=$(node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" resolve-model forge-roadmapper --raw)
```

Use the Agent tool to spawn **forge-roadmapper** with (pass `model` if non-empty):
- The project ID, milestone ID, and milestone goal
- All requirement IDs with their titles and descriptions
- Phase numbering context (continue from last phase number)
- Any user-specified constraints on ordering

The roadmapper will analyze requirements and propose 3-8 phases.

Present the proposed phases to the user for review. Let them reorder, merge, split, or rename phases. Iterate until they approve.

Then create the approved phases:
```bash
# Use forge-tools for each phase (handles numbering and wiring):
node "$HOME/.claude/forge/bin/forge-tools.cjs" add-phase <project-id> <phase-description>
```

Wire each phase to the milestone:
```bash
bd dep add <phase-id> <milestone-id> --type=parent-child
```

## 8. Show Summary

Display the milestone structure:
```bash
bd dep tree <milestone-id>
```

Summarize:
- Milestone goal (one sentence)
- N requirements defined
- N phases planned
- Phase overview (numbered list with titles)
- Next step: `/forge:plan` to plan the first phase

Save milestone for future reference:
```bash
bd remember "forge:session:last-milestone <milestone-id>"
```
